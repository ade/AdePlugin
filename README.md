AdePlugin
=========

a minecraft (craftbukkit) plugin

tested working with CraftBukkit/Spigot 1.13.2

Features
========

Warp Stones
-----------
A mechanism for creating teleporters in game without using text-commands. Two special warp blocks are created via a crafting recipe. To bind a source warp to a destination, a "signature" system is used, where four adjacent wool blocks define a warp destination.

A warp source or destination looks from above like:
```
 W
WTW
 W
```
Where W is Wool, and T is a special teleporter block, with a stone pressure plate on top. The color of the wool around defines the destination. If multiple destinations exist, a random one is selected. This makes this feature unsafe with untrusted players, as warps can be hijacked. The ordering of the wool blocks is not important, just the amounts of each color.

Warp block recipe (4 Redstone, 4 Gold Ingot, Ender Pearl):

Warp destination block recipe (4 Redstone, 4 Coal, Ender Pearl):

Warp placement example:

As four wool blocks are selected in an unordered fashion from a pool of 16 different colors, the number of possible warp destinations is 3876.


Building
========
Add a bukkit API jar (such as Spigot-API) to the libs folder.
Refer to the Spigot website and see their BuildTools for more info. 

Then use gradle to build. You can start a build by running
```
./gradlew build
or
./gradlew.bat build (windows)
